# Phases of P:

The following are the phases of project work:
    
1. <b>Proposal Submission:</b> Students must submit and present project proposal after 3rd week of start of the sixth semester.

2. <b>Mid-Term:</b> Students must submit progress report and defend midterm progress of their project work in the 12" week of the sixth semester.

3. <b>Final Submission:</b> Students must submit and orally defend the project work during last week of the sixth semester but before final board examination. Students must have to submit the project final report to their respective department before at least ten days of final defense date. The report should be submitted in standard format as prescribed. The hard/soft copy of report should be made available to the external expert before a week of presentation date. The final presentation should be followed by the demonstration session, where students have to demonstrate the project. A viva voice will be conducted by evaluation committee.

# Evaluation Scheme:

1. <b>Proposal Defense</b> of 10% of total marks based on project proposal and its presentation.

2. <b>Midterm</b> of 70% of total marks based on;
    
    a. Work Done 60%

        i. System Analysis and Design
        ii. Implementation
        ii. Understanding of methods used in project
        iv. Ability to work with others
        v. Ability to identify problems
        vi. Amount of work performed

    b. Documentation 10%

        i. Report Organization
        i. Writing Style
        ii. Completeness of Report
        iv. Readability
        v. Organization and analysis of data and results

3. **Final Defense** of 20% of total marks based on presentation and project demonstration and viva-voice. Each group member should present about the project followed by the demonstration of project developed. The project should be ready to run for the demo session.
